# Walmart sales data analysis

![walmart_project-piplelines](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6dce697e-e032-4e1c-83c0-ce8d8710045d)
This project provides a comprehensive, end-to-end data analysis solution to extract essential business insights from Walmart sales data. Leveraging Python for data processing, SQL for querying, and structured problem-solving, this project addresses key business questions. It is designed for data analysts to develop skills in data manipulation, SQL querying, and data pipeline development.





Project Workflow


Step 1: Environment Setup

Tools: Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Python, SQL (MySQL and PostgreSQL)

Objective: Establish a structured workspace in VS Code to enable smooth development and data management.




Step 2: Configuring the Kaggle API

API Access: Download your API token from Kaggle under profile settings as a JSON file.

Setup:
Place kaggle.json in the local .kaggle directory.
Use kaggle datasets download -d <dataset-path> to download datasets directly into your project.




Step 3: Download Walmart Sales Data

Data Source: Use the Kaggle API to download Walmart sales data.
Dataset Link: Walmart Sales Dataset
Storage Location: Save data files in the data/ folder for easy reference.




Step 4: Install Libraries and Load Data

Install Dependencies:
\`\`\`bash
pip install pandas numpy sqlalchemy mysql-connector-python psycopg2
\`\`\`
Load Data: Use Pandas to load data into DataFrames for initial analysis and transformations.




Step 5: Data Exploration
Objective:
Understand data structure, distribution, and detect any issues.
Methods: Use .info(), .describe(), and .head() to explore data properties and statistics.




Step 6: Data Cleaning
De-duplication: Remove duplicate entries for accurate analysis.
Handle Missing Data: Drop rows/columns with insignificant missing values or fill values as necessary.
Standardize Data Types: Ensure consistent data types (e.g., datetime for dates, float for prices).
Currency Formatting: Use .replace() for currency formatting.
Validation: Perform final checks for data consistency.



Step 7: Feature Engineering

Add New Metrics: Create a Total Amount column by multiplying unit_price by quantity.
Enhanced Analysis: This new metric will simplify further SQL aggregation.




Step 8: Load Data into SQL Databases

Database Connections: Connect to MySQL and PostgreSQL using sqlalchemy and load the cleaned data.
Automated Table Creation: Use SQLAlchemy to automate table creation and data insertion.
Verification: Run test SQL queries to ensure data accuracy.




Step 9: SQL Analysis – Advanced Queries

Business Insights: Write complex SQL queries to address business questions, including:
Revenue trends by branch and category.
Top-selling product categories.
Sales patterns by city, time, and payment methods.
Peak sales periods and customer behavior.
Profit margin analysis by branch and category.
Documentation: Log each query’s purpose, approach, and results.




Step 10: Final Documentation and Project Publishing

Documentation: Record all processes in Markdown or Jupyter Notebooks.
Publish on GitHub: Include:
This README.md.
Jupyter Notebooks, if applicable.
SQL query scripts.
Data files or instructions for access.




Requirements

Python: Version 3.8+
Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL
Python Libraries:
